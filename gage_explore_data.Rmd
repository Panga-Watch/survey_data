```

Determine if I have questions about variables in the data

```{r}
## survey_type
unique(master_surv_resp$survey_type)
#[1] "D"    "FLAG"
# there is only one "FLAG" observation....
## What does "FLAG" mean? "D" means "Data Collection". How come there are no "training" or "t" observations, as specified in "Survey Key.xlsx"? 

## survey_id
length(unique(master_surv_resp$survey_id))
## makes sense... each observation has it's own survey_id. The first number corresponds to the administered location. 

## survey_version
unique(master_surv_resp$survey_version)
#16. Corresponds to each choice experiment. 

## interviewer
# name of each interviewer. There are three "JS"'s. What do the *'s mean? 

## interviewer_Org 
# the interviewer's organization
unique(master_surv_resp$interviewer_Org)
# we had 4 different organizations helping to administer surveys!

## community
unique(master_surv_resp$community)
# [1] "RAJ" "MAK" "MNC" "PSC" "ALT" "TTN" "WKB"
# What is "WKB"? Not specified in "Survey Key.xlsx"
# What does "TTN" stand for? 
# "MAK" means "Muara Angke".

## gear columns
# Each gear column specifies whether they use a certain type of gear or not. 1 for yes, 0 for no.
