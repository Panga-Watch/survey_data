```

```{r}
master_surv_resp <- read_csv("master_survey_resp.csv")
```

Determine if I have questions about variables in the data

```{r}
## survey_type
unique(master_surv_resp$survey_type)
#[1] "D"    "FLAG"
# there is only one "FLAG" observation....
## What does "FLAG" mean? "D" means "Data Collection". How come there are no "training" or "t" observations, as specified in "Survey Key.xlsx"? 

## survey_id
length(unique(master_surv_resp$survey_id))
## makes sense... each observation has it's own survey_id. The first number corresponds to the administered location. 

## survey_version
unique(master_surv_resp$survey_version)
#16. Corresponds to each choice experiment. 

## interviewer
# name of each interviewer. There are three "JS"'s. What do the *'s mean? 

## interviewer_Org 
# the interviewer's organization
unique(master_surv_resp$interviewer_Org)
# we had 4 different organizations helping to administer surveys!

## community
unique(master_surv_resp$community)
# [1] "RAJ" "MAK" "MNC" "PSC" "ALT" "TTN" "WKB"

count(master_surv_resp, vars = community)
# ALT	37			
# MAK	59			
# MNC	27			
# PSC	46			
# RAJ	18			
# TTN	4			
# WKB	14	

# What is "WKB"? Not specified in "Survey Key.xlsx" -- probably Wakatobi, Indonesia 
# What does "TTN" stand for? 
# "MAK" means "Muara Angke".

## gear columns
# Each gear column specifies whether they use a certain type of gear or not. 1 for yes, 0 for no.

## positive_tracking_tech_one
## positive_tracking_tech_two
## negative_tracking_tech_one
## negative_tracking_tech_two
# do these need to be translated? 

## wtp_1 
# $5 

## wtp_2 
# $10

## wtp_3 
# $15

## wtp_4 
# $20

## wtr_1
# $5

## wtr_2
# $10

## wtr_3 
# $15

## wtr_4
# $20

############## What does it mean when there are NAs in the above columns? 

## tracking_negative
## tracking_positive 
# do these need to be translated? 

## design_**
# Note to self: Should check these to see that none of them have chosen > 3 benefits... probably some sort of filter on each of these columns or something...

## text_vms_adoption
# translate? 

## target_species_*** 
# translate?

## fraction_**
# Note to self: check to see if these all add up to 100%

## other_fraction
# translate?

## fishing_org_type
# what do NAs in this column mean? 

## other_access
# translate 

## other_restriction
# translate 

## rank_***
# is there a reason there are NAs in these? For instance, an observation has rank_1,2,3 all NA, but rank_four is filled out.

## catch_trends 
# this is ok

## opinion_*
# why are there a couple NAs?

## trust_*
# looks ok. Maybe a couple of NAs...

## income
# do we need to change the currency?


```

General notes: 
 - Confused about what NAs in the dataset mean. Could they skip questions? 
 - Is there a translated version of the dataset?
